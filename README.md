# Cloudflare DNS Updater

The Cloudflare DNS Updater (AutoDNS) is a Flask-based application designed to automate the updating of A records on Cloudflare. Using GUIDs for DNS record identification, it features automatic IP detection from incoming requests and integrates with Apprise for sending notifications upon successful updates or when errors occur.

## Features

- **Automatic IP Detection:** Automatically determines the IP address from incoming requests, including handling of `X-Forwarded-For` headers for proxied requests.
- **GUID-based Identification:** Securely identifies the DNS record to update using GUIDs.
- **Notifications:** Sends notifications through a variety of services using Apprise upon successful updates or errors.
